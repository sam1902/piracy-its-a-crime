# Piracy. It's a Crime.

This website is from [the infamous "Piracy. It's a Crime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU) video that used 
to be added to many DVDs in the early 2000s.

I now host the website at [piracyitsacrime.com](https://piracyitsacrime.com/) because I believe it's an important piece 
history, it's weird the domain wasn't registered, and it's a really cool trailer.
